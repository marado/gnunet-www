Sourcecode for https://gnunet.org created from the https://taler.net code base.

Requires python3-jinja2, python3-babel, and gettext.

Run "make" to build the HTML.

Expect it to show up in en/ and other language folders, NOT in the root dir.

Commentary:
This website has been tested with python 3.6.5 and jinja2 2.9.6.
Since python development in collaborative environments with
a whole range of possibilities in what your environment looks
like, please state problems on the mailinglist instead of just
fixing what *could* work for you.

Thanks!
