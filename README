==============
GNUnet Website
==============

Sourcecode for https://gnunet.org created from the https://taler.net code base.

Requires python3-jinja2, python3-babel, and gettext.

Run "make" to build the HTML.

Expect it to show up in en/ and other language folders, NOT in the root dir.


Developing with GNU Guix
========================

Creating an ad-hoc development environment containing all of the necessary
software needed to build the HTML files can be easily done using the GNU 
Guix functional package manager.

This can be achieved with the following command:

`guix environment --ad-hoc coreutils bash python python-babel python-jinja2 gettext-minimal make -- bash`

After installing the packages, this will drop you into a bash environment
from which you can proceed to run "make".


Notes
=====

This website has been tested with python 3.6.5 and jinja2 2.9.6.
Since python development in collaborative environments with
a whole range of possibilities in what your environment looks
like, please state problems on the mailinglist instead of just
fixing what *could* work for you.

Thanks!
