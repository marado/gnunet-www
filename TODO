- about-page:
  * The page, like the rest of the pages, must be finetuned for responsive
    layouts.
  * Either provide no image or upload your images!

- Do we need ALL the boilerplate of bootstrap css?

- architecture-page:
  * The graph image does not really display well on small screens.

- branding / navigation:
  * Can we get a hover image for the navbar logo?
