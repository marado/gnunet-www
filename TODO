- about-page:
  * The page, like the rest of the pages, must be finetuned for responsive
    layouts.
  * Either provide no image or upload your images!

- Do we need ALL the boilerplate of bootstrap css?

* Layout / CSS:
- Firefox Reader Mode does not display all of our pages in full.

- architecture-page:
  * The graph image does not really display well on small screens.

- branding / navigation:
  * Can we get a hover image for the navbar logo?

- Makefile:
  * conditionally without gmake extensions pick up values for BABEL and
    PYTHON. They can be python3, python2, python2.7, pybabel, pybabel-2.7
    etc.
  * Ideally don't require gmake to run make.

template.py:
  * it is currently broken with python2.7. Since I use python3.7 and
    2.7 is on its way out: person who cares enough for 2.7, step up
    to fix this in a portable way (in other words, do not break
    various corner cases for relative imports in the 3.x series!).
    The mechanism is currently like an USB cable, 1st attempt fails,
    second succeeds. reproducible, annoying, maybe don't fix it. 

news:
  * should be presented in an easier format as per inclusion / presentation.
