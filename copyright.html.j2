    <p>Contributors to GNU Taler with Git access must sign the

    ensure that the GNUnet e.V. --- Taler Systems SA agreement
    on licensing and collaborative development of the GNUnet and
    GNU Taler projects is satisfied.</p>

    <p>The agreements ensure that the code will continue to be made
    available under free software licenses, but gives us the freedom
    to move code between GNUnet and GNU Taler and the ability to
    dual-license.</p>

    <p>Minor contributions (basically, anyone without Git access) do
    not require copyright assignment. Pseudonymous contributions are
    accepted, in this case simply sign the agreement with your
    pseudonym. Scanned copies are sufficient, but snail mail is
    preferred.</p>
