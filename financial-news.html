          <p>Security researchers found serious security flaws in the German &quot;electronic cash&quot; system
             which enable criminals to withdraw funds from merchant accounts based on the information printed
             on receipts and other information obtained from public sources or point-of-sales terminals purchased
             online.<br>
             The German &quot;electronic cash&quot; system is based on the &quot;Poseidon&quot; protocol, for
             which there is no publicly accessible specification or reference implementation. This has allowed

          <p>&quot;Suppose you were an advisor to the head of the KGB,
          the Soviet Secret Police. Suppose you are given the
          assignment of designing a system for the surveillance of all
          citizens and visitors within the boundaries of the USSR. The
          system is not to be too obtrusive or obvious. What would be
          your decision?&quot;<br>
          The think tank RAND essentially answered this question with
          a blueprint for modern payment systems.  Taler offers an

          <h2>10-9-2014: PayPal accounts hacked with a click</h2>
          <p>Yasser Ali reports a now patched vulnerability in PayPal that would
             have allowed him to reset other user's passwords and take over their
             accounts. This is unlikely to be the last vulnerability found in
             account-based payment systems.<br>
             In Taler, customers do not have accounts with usernames, passwords
             or associated e-mail addresses.  Instead, Taler uses reserves which
             are represented by a private key on the owner's computer.  Users
             create a reserve by depositing currency at a Taler exchange, and can then
             withdraw digital coins from that reserve using the respective private
             key.  There is no limit on the number of reserves a user can have, and
             even hacking the Taler exchange would not provide an adversary with access to
             user's reserves (as the Taler exchange does not have the private keys).
             Stealing in Taler requires breaking into each customer's computer to
             extract the reserve keys or the coins from the digital wallet.

          <p>Visa and MasterCard are planning to &quot;simplify hated verification
             systems&quot; by moving from passwords to security codes on mobiles
             and biometrics.  Continuing their flawed insistence on verifying identity,
             Visa and MasterCard will thus build a very personal picture of their
             customers, from shopping habbits down to their cardiac rhythm.<br>
             Taler does not require a customer's identity to verify a payment, as the
             payment system cryptographically verifies the coins.  Thus, Taler does
             not have to intrude into any personal detail of a citizen's life, and
             certainly not their private medical data.

             target international payment processors including SWIFT and Visa.
             As terrorism and organized crime are covered by legal means, industrial
             espionage to improve the US economy is the only remaining US national
             interest within the NSA's mandate that would explain this illegal activity.<br>
             With Taler, exchanges will only learn the value of a merchant's transactions,
             not who paid or for what (governments may learn what was sold).  Thus,
             the Taler exchange is a significantly less interesting target for industrial
             espionage.
