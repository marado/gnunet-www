	           built with the goal of fighting corruption and supporting taxation.  
	           With Taler, the receiver of any form of payment is
	           easily identified by the government, and the merchant
                   can be compelled to provide the contract that was accepted
                   by the customer.  Governments can use this data to
	           tax businesses and individuals based on their

                   spending digital cash to buy goods and services,
                   Taler also ensures that the state can observe
                   incoming funds. This can be used to ensure
                   businesses engage only in legal activities, and do
                   not evade income tax, sales tax or value-added tax.
                   However, this observational capability does not
                   extend to the immediate personal domain.  In
                   particular, sharing access to funds within a family
                   or synchronizing wallets across multiple devices is not
