      Taler is an electronic payment system under
      development

          When using Taler, merchants can't hide their income from tax
          collection authorities.  Unlike cash and most digital currencies,
          Taler helps preventing black markets.

          When you pay with Taler, your identity does not
          have to be revealed to the merchant. Just like
          payments in cash, nobody else can track how you
          spent your electronic money. However, you obtain a
          legally valid proof of payment.

          Taler provides protocols and reference implementations that in
          principle enables anybody to run their own payment infrastructure,
          be it individuals, organizations or whole countries.  Since the
          reference implementation is a <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU</a>
          package, it will always remain free software.

          {% trans %}
          Taler is easy to integrate with existing Web
          applications. Payments are cryptographically
          secured and are confirmed within milliseconds with
          extremely low transaction costs.

        <p>
          {% trans %}
          Taler does not introduce a new currency with
          fluctuation risks, and instead uses a digital
          wallet holding coins in reserve. Taler's
          cryptographic coins correspond to existing
          currencies, such as US Dollars, Euros or even
          Bitcoins.

        <p>
          {% trans %}
          By design Taler does not suffer from many classes
          of security problems such as phishing or conterfeit.
          Despite its security features, Taler never rejects a legitimate
          customer due to a fraud-detection false positive.

      <h2>Paying with Taler</h2>
      <p>In order to pay with Taler, users install a wallet browser extension
      or app on their device.  Before the first payment, the wallet's balance must
      be charged by some other means of payment for the desired currency.</p>
      <p>Once the wallet is charged, payments on websites take only one click, are never falsely rejected
      by fraud detection and do not post any risk of phishing or identity theft.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-6">
      <h2>Receiving payments with Taler</h2>
      <p>To receive Taler payments, a merchant only needs a bank account (or
      any other kind of payment address) in the desired currency.  We provide an
      SDK in various languages that makes the integration into a merchant's store
      painless.  The merchant's backend for Taler transaction processing can run
      on the mechant's premises or be a hosted backend.</p>
      <p>When using a hosted backend, setting up a website that accepts taler
      payments is a matter of minutes.</p>
