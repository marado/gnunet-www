        Protocols from Ethernet and IP to BGP and X.509 PKI fail by being unsecure-by-default: protecting against address forgery, routers learning metadata, or choosing really trusted CAs is nontrivial and sometimes nigh impossible.
        <br><br>
        GNUnet is an Internet <a href="https://www.w3.org/2014/strint/papers/65.pdf">secure-by-design</a>, addressing addressing, routing, naming and content distribution in a technically robust manner - as opposed to ad-hoc designs in place today.

        {% trans %}
        It seems like every other P2P project develops its own library stack, covering transports, stream muxing, discovery and others. This divides effort and multiplies bug count.
        <br><br>
        GNUnet is a metadata-preserving foundation for your application, covering areas from addressing to reliable bidirectional Axolotl-encrypted channels, with advanced routing.  Our work is based on continuous research spanning almost two decades.

        Even though transport encryption is increasingly being deployed in the Internet, it can only do so much: sender and receiver, times, frequency and the volume of communication are all revealed, which enables reverse engineering pages visited and website fingerprinting, as demonstrated with Tor.
        <br><br>
        GNUnet addresses these concerns with Perfect Forward Secrecy via ephemeral public key addressing, fixed packet size to hinder traffic analysis, layered encryption, Sybil-resistant routing, and others.

        GNUnet gives users freedoms to securely access information (“run” the network), to study all aspects of the network’s operation (“access the code”), to distribute information (“copy”), as well as the freedom to deploy new applications (“modify”).

        The GNU Name System (GNS) is a fully decentralized replacement

	are similar to DNS, but queries and replies are private even
	with respect to peers providing the answers.  The integrity of
	records is cryptographically secured.  GNS integrates
	a robust, efficient and instant key revocation mechanism.

	Each subsystem runs as a separate process, providing
