      GNUnet is a new network stack for building secure, decentralized and

        The conventional Internet is currently like a system of roads with deep potholes and highwaymen all over the place. Even if you still can use the roads (e.g. send emails, or browse websites) your vehicle might get hijacked, damaged, or long ugly arms might reach into its back and steal your items (data) to use it against you and sell it to others - while you can't even notice the thievery nor accuse and hold the scroungers accountable.

          Even though transport encryption is increasingly being deployed in the Internet, it can only do so much: sender and receiver, times, frequency and the volume of communication are all revealed, which enables reverse engineering pages visited and website fingerprinting, as demonstrated with Tor.

          GNUnet addresses these concerns with Perfect Forward Secrecy via ephemeral public key addressing, fixed packet size to hinder traffic analysis, layered encryption, Sybil-resistant routing, and others.
