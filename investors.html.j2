             All transactions in Taler are secured using <a href="bibliography.html">modern
             cryptography</a> and trust in all parties is
             minimized. Financial damage is bounded (for
             customers, merchants and the exchange) even in the
             case that systems are compromised and private keys
             are stolen.  Databases can be audited for
             consistency, resulting in either the detection of
             compromised systems or the demonstration that
             participants were honest. Actual transaction costs
             are fractions of a cent.

        {% trans %}
             The scalable business model for Taler is the operation
             of the payment service provider, which converts money from
             traditional payment systems (MasterCard, SEPA, UPI,
             Visa, Bitcoin, ACH, SWIFT, etc.) to anonymous
             electronic coins in the same currency. The customer
             can then redeem the electronic coins at a merchant,
             who can exchange them for money represented using
             traditional payment systems at the exchange.  The
             exchange charges fees to facilitate the transactions.
