"The Taler system consists of protocols executed among a number of actors as "
"illustrated in the illustration on the right. Typical transactions involve "
"the following steps:"
msgstr ""

#: developers.html.j2:158
msgid ""
"A customer instructs his <b>bank</b> to transfer funds from his account to "
"the Taler exchange (top left). In the subject of the transaction, he "
"includes an authentication token from his electronic <b>wallet</b>. In Taler "
"terminology, the customer creates a reserve at the exchange."
msgstr ""

#: developers.html.j2:170
msgid ""
"Once the exchange has received the wire transfer, it allows the customer's "
"electronic wallet to <b>withdraw</b> electronic coins. The electronic coins "
"are digital representations of the original currency from the transfer. It "
"is important to note that the exchange does not learn the &quot;serial "
"numbers&quot; of the coins created in this process, so it cannot tell later "
"which customer purchased what at which merchant. The use of Taler does not "
"change the currency or the total value of the funds (except for fees which "
"the exchange may charge for the service)."
msgstr ""

#: developers.html.j2:188
msgid ""
"Once the customer has the digital coins in his wallet, the wallet can be "
"used to <b>spend</b> the coins with merchant portals that support the Taler "
"payment system and accept the respective exchange as a business partner "
"(bottom arrow). This creates a digital contract signed by the customer's "
"coins and the merchant. If necessary, the customer can later use this "
"digitally signed contract in a court of law to prove the exact terms of the "
"contract and that he paid the respective amount. The customer does not learn "
"the banking details of the merchant, and Taler does not require the merchant "
"to learn the identity of the customer. Naturally, the customer can spend any "
"fraction of his digital coins (the system takes care of customers getting "
"change)."
msgstr ""

#: developers.html.j2:210
msgid ""
"Merchants receiving digital coins <b>deposit</b> the respective claims that "
"resulted from the contract signing with the customer at the exchange to "
"redeem the coins. The deposit step does not reveal the details of the "
"contract between the customer and the merchant or the identity of the "
"customer to the exchange in any way. However, the exchange does learn the "
"identity of the merchant via the provided bank routing information. The "
"merchant can, for example when compelled by the state for taxation, provide "
"information linking the individual deposit to the respective contract signed "
"by the customer. Thus, the exchange's database allows the state to enforce "
"that merchants pay applicable taxes (and do not engage in illegal contracts)."
msgstr ""

#: developers.html.j2:233
msgid ""
"Finally, the exchange transfers funds corresponding to the digital coins "
"redeemed by the merchants to the merchant's <b>bank</b> account. The "
"exchange may combine multiple small transactions into one larger bank "
"transfer. The merchant can query the exchange about the relationship between "
"the bank transfers and the individual claims that were deposited."
msgstr ""

#: developers.html.j2:247
msgid ""
"Most importantly, the exchange keeps cryptographic proofs that allow it to "
"demonstrate that it is operating correctly to third parties. The system "
"requires an external <b>auditor</b>, such as a government-appointed "
"financial regulatory body, to frequently verify the exchange's databases and "
"check that its bank balance matches the total value of the remaining coins "
"in circulation."
msgstr ""

#: developers.html.j2:262
msgid ""
"Without the auditor, the exchange operators could embezzle funds they are "
"holding in reserve. Customers and merchants cannot cheat each other or the "
"exchange. If any party's computers are compromised, the financial damage is "
"limited to the respective party and proportional to the funds they have in "
"circulation during the period of the compromise."
