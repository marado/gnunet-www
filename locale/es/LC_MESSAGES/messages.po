"For GNUnet, we also need a particularly modern version of GnuTLS. Thus, it "

"one links cURL against this version of GnuTLS? Well, first one would install "
"GnuTLS by hand in the system. Then, we build cURL. cURL will build against "
"it just fine, but the linker will eventually complain bitterly. The reason "
"is that cURL also links against a bunch of other system libraries (gssapi, "
"ldap, ssh2, rtmp, krb5, sasl2, see discussion on obscure protocols above), "
"which --- as they are part of the distribution --- were linked against an "
"older version of GnuTLS. As a result, the same binary would be linked "
"against two different versions of GnuTLS. That is typically a recipe for "
"disaster. Thus, in order to avoid updating a dozen system libraries (and "
"having two versions of those installed), it is necessary to disable all of "
"those cURL features that GNUnet does not use, and there are many of those. "
"For GNUnet, the more obscure protocols supported by cURL are close to dead "
"code --- mostly harmless, but not useful. However, as some application may "

"So to use a modern version of GnuTLS, a sane approach is to disable all of "

"other parts of the system that might depend on these features that we just "
"disabled. Libtool versioning doesn't help here, as it is not intended to "
"deal with libraries that have optional features. Naturally, installing cURL "
"somewhere else is also problematic, as we now need to be really careful that "

"stick with the original cURL. Those that do not, can choose to move to "

"The GNUnet team is currently working on a transport layer rewrite in order "
"to fix core issues with connectivity. This new component is currently "
"developed under the name \"TNG\". What is currently known as \"transport "
"plugins\" will in the TNG be represented as \"communicators\". Communicators "
"are processes with a well defined API that allow to connect peers over a "
"specific protocol. The primary protocol which are already implemented are "
"UNIX sockets, UDP sockets, and TCP sockets. For a truly resilient network, "
"other connectivity options such as WiFi mesh, Bluetooth, HTTP(S), QUIC or "
