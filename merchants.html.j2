               Processing transactions with Taler is fast,
               allowing you to confirm the transaction with your
               customer virtually immediately.  Your customers
               will appreciate that they do not have to type in
               credit card information and play the &quot;verified
               by&quot; game.  By making payments significantly
               more convenient for your customers, you may be able
               to use Taler for small transactions that would not
               work with credit card payments due to the mental
               overhead for customers.

               Taler payment service provider. With Taler you never

               do not have to undergo any particular security audits
               (such as PCI DSS).  Your systems will have customer
               contracts with qualified signatures for all
               transactions which you can use in court in case of
               disputes.
