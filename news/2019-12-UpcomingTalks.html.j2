    In addition to these talks, we will be hosting a snack machine which
    accepts <a href="https://taler.net">Taler</a> for payment.
    The first of its kind! It will be filled
    with various goodies, including Swiss chocolates, books, and electronics.
    The machine will be located somewhere in the OIO assembly, and there
    will be a station at which you may exchange Euro for digital Euro for
    immediate use.
    We welcome all to come try it out. :)
