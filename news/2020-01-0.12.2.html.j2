  <h1>GNUnet 0.12.2 released</h1>
<p>
  We are pleased to announce the release of GNUnet 0.12.2.
<br>
  This is a new minor release.
  In terms of usability, users should be aware that there are still
  <b>a large number of known open issues</b> in particular with respect to ease
  of use, but also some critical privacy issues especially for mobile users.
  Also, the nascent network is tiny and thus unlikely to
  provide good anonymity or extensive amounts of interesting information.
  As a result, the 0.12.2 release is still <b>only suitable for early adopters
  with some reasonable pain tolerance</b>.
</p>

<h4>Noteworthy changes in 0.12.2 (since 0.12.1)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <tt>GNS</tt>: Resolver clients are now able to specify a recursion depth limit.
  </li>
  <li>
    <tt>TRANSPORT/TNG</tt>: The transport rewrite (aka TNG) is underway and
    various transport components have been worked on, including TCP, UDP and UDS
    communicators.
  </li>
  <li>
    <tt>RECLAIM</tt>: Added preliminary support for third party attested
    credentials.
  </li>
  <li>
    <tt>UTIL</tt>: The cryprography changes introduced in 0.12.0 broke ECDSA
      ECDH and consequently other components. The offending ECDSA key normalization
      was dropped.
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Known Issues</h4>
<ul>
  <li>There are known major design issues in the TRANSPORT, ATS and CORE subsystems which will need to be addressed in the future to achieve acceptable usability, performance and security.</li>
  <li>There are known moderate implementation limitations in CADET that negatively impact performance.</li>
  <li>There are known moderate design issues in FS that also impact usability and performance.</li>
  <li>There are minor implementation limitations in SET that create unnecessary attack surface for availability.</li>
  <li>The RPS subsystem remains experimental.</li>
  <li>Some high-level tests in the test-suite fail non-deterministically due to the low-level TRANSPORT issues.</li>
</ul>
