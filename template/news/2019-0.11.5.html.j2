  <h1>GNUnet 0.11.5 released</h1>
<p>
  We are pleased to announce the release of GNUnet 0.11.5.
<br>
  This is a bugfix release for 0.11.4, mostly fixing a few minor bugs and improving performance, in particular for identity management with a large number of egos. In the wake of this release, we also launched the <a href="https://rest.gnunet.org">REST API documentation</a>. In terms of usability, users should be aware that there are still a large number of known open issues in particular with respect to ease of use, but also some critical privacy issues especially for mobile users. Also, the nascent network is tiny (about 200 peers) and thus unlikely to provide good anonymity or extensive amounts of interesting information.  As a result, the 0.11.5 release is still only suitable for early adopters with some reasonable pain tolerance.

<p>
  gnunet-gtk saw some minor changes to adopt it to API changes in the main code related to the identity improvements. gnunet-fuse was not released again, as there were no changes and the 0.11.0 version is expected to continue to work fine with gnunet-0.11.5.

<h4>Noteworthy changes in 0.11.5 (since 0.11.4)</h4>
<ul>
  <li><tt>gnunet-identity</tt> is much faster when creating or deleting egos given a large number of existing egos.</li>
  <li>GNS now supports CAA records.</li>
  <li>Documentation, comments and code quality was improved.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Known Issues</h4>
<ul>
  <li>There are known major design issues in the TRANSPORT, ATS and CORE subsystems which will need to be addressed in the future to achieve acceptable usability, performance and security.</li>
  <li>There are known moderate implementation limitations in CADET that negatively impact performance. Also CADET may unexpectedly deliver messages out-of-order.</li>
  <li>There are known moderate design issues in FS that also impact usability and performance.</li>
  <li>There are minor implementation limitations in SET that create unnecessary attack surface for availability.</li>
  <li>The RPS subsystem remains experimental.</li>
  <li>Some high-level tests in the test-suite fail non-deterministically due to the low-level TRANSPORT issues.</li>
</ul>
