  <h1>No GSoC projects in 2021</h1>
<p>
  For 2021, <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/summer-of-code/2021-03/msg00000.html">GNU has not been selected as a GSoC organization</a>.
  This also means that <a href="{{ url_localized('gsoc.html')}}">GNUnet GSoC
  projects</a> will not be offered through the GSoC programme.
  Thanks to all of those interested in our proposed projects and their efforts
  in preparing proposals, including preliminary discussions with us.
  If you are still interested in tackling any of the proposed open issues, you
  are very welcome to do so.
